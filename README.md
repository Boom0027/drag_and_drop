# Drag and drop
A drag and drop project manager

## Splitting code into modules in typescript 
1. Write multiple ts files and manually import the ts files in html - not a good option
2. Namespaces and file bundling - Imports and imported files are bundled into one file so we have less imports to manage in an html file
3. ES6 import/export. Requires a bundler like webpack for bundling

## What is web pack ?
1. It is a bundling, build orchestration tool 
2. It is used for optimization and minification as well
3. Add more build steps
